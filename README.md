# AI-Driven-Fraud-Prevention-for-Financial-Transactions

## Overview

The **AI-Driven Fraud Prevention for Financial Transactions** project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to accurately detect and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions. By leveraging **XGBoost**, an efficient gradient-boosting model, and **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** for model interpretability, this project offers a comprehensive solution to fraud detection, focusing on real-time transaction monitoring and actionable fraud prevention strategies.

## Features

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection**: Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time with high accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes XGBoost for predictive modeling based on historical transaction data.
- **Feature Importance**: Uses SHAP values to explain the model's decision-making process and identify key fraud indicators.
- **Actionable Prevention Strategies**: Provides infrastructure-level recommendations for preventing fraud based on model predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes performance metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model effectiveness.
- **Continuous Effectiveness Monitoring**: Suggests A/B testing and monitoring methods to evaluate the fraud prevention system's long-term performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing, model development, and evaluation.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful machine learning algorithm for fraud detection that handles imbalanced datasets efficiently.
- **SHAP**: A tool for model interpretability, allowing us to understand feature importance.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and handling missing values.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for visualizing data and model performance.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load your transaction dataset (`fraud.csv`) into the `df` DataFrame.
   - Preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Perform feature selection and create new features (e.g., balance differences, transaction ratios).
   - One-hot encode the transaction type feature.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the **XGBoost model** on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as **AUC-ROC**, **confusion matrix**, and **SHAP values**.
   - Analyze the feature importance using **SHAP summary plots**.

5. **Fraud Prevention Recommendations**:
   - Based on the model's predictions, generate actionable fraud prevention steps, such as:
     - Monitoring suspicious patterns.
     - Blocking certain transaction types (e.g., `TRANSFER` followed by `CASH_OUT` within 1 hour).

6. **Effectiveness Measurement**:
   - Use **A/B testing** to measure the effectiveness of the fraud prevention system by comparing fraud detection rates and false positive rates across different groups.

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **AUC-ROC**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into the model's accuracy, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Evaluate the trade-off between precision and recall, essential for fraud detection tasks.
  
### Example Evaluation Output:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Fraud Prevention Recommendations

Based on the model's output, here are some recommended actions:
1. **Transaction Pattern Monitoring**: Continuously monitor transactions with high risk, such as those exceeding a specific threshold or involving unusual transaction types.
2. **Account Locking**: Automatically lock accounts showing suspicious activity and flag them for further review.
3. **Rate-Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting for accounts performing high-value transfers in a short period (e.g., multiple transfers within an hour).
4. **Fraud Scoring System**: Implement a fraud scoring system that assigns a score to each transaction and triggers manual review if it exceeds a threshold.

## How to Measure Effectiveness

1. **A/B Testing**: 
   - **Group A**: Transactions detected using existing fraud detection methods.
   - **Group B**: Transactions flagged using the new model along with manual review.

2. **Key Metrics**:
   - **Fraud Catch Rate**: The percentage of fraudulent transactions detected.
   - **False Positive Rate**: The percentage of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud.
   - **Reduction in Fraud Losses**: Measure the decrease in actual fraud losses over time.

## Conclusion

This project provides a robust and scalable solution for fraud detection using machine learning, specifically **XGBoost**. The integration of **SHAP** for model interpretability and the inclusion of fraud prevention strategies offers a practical and actionable approach for businesses to prevent financial fraud. The continuous monitoring and evaluation methods ensure the system remains effective over time.
